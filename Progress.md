Database Setup & Configuration
Set up PostgreSQL database using Docker container for development
Configured PostgreSQL with credentials: postgres:password123 on port 5432
Created database named ai_hedge_fund for the hedge fund simulation
Environment Configuration
Fixed .env file with proper database connection string
Resolved placeholder values in DATABASE_URL that were causing connection errors
Configured environment variables for JWT authentication secrets
Prisma Database Migration
Successfully ran initial Prisma migration (init_auth_fund)
Created core database schema with 4 main models:
User - Authentication and user management
Fund - Hedge fund/portfolio entities with ownership
Position - Trading positions within funds (entry/exit tracking)
StockData - Market data storage for backtesting
Generated Prisma Client for database operations
Database schema now in sync with application models
Development Environment
Resolved Docker Desktop connectivity issues
Established persistent PostgreSQL container for development
Configured Prisma Studio access on http://localhost:5555
Set up proper database relationships and constraints
Infrastructure Issues Resolved
Fixed database connection errors (P1001 - Can't reach database server)
Resolved port mismatch issues between configuration files
Ensured proper environment variable loading with dotenv
Project Structure
Backend configured with PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
Authentication-ready user system with BCrypt password hashing
Multi-fund portfolio management structure
Foundation for trading position tracking and market data storage
The project now has a fully functional database layer ready for building the hedge fund simulation API endpoints and authentication system.

Phase 4: Market Data Integration - COMPLETED
Created market data service (src/services/dataFetcher.ts) with Alpaca API integration
Implemented data ingestion endpoints for historical stock data fetching and storage
Added market data APIs: /api/data/ingest, /api/data/latest, /api/data/historical/:symbol, /api/data/validate
Enhanced database with sample stock data for AAPL and MSFT (3 days each)
Tested with demo credentials - all endpoints functional and ready for real Alpaca API keys

Phase 5: Fund Management System - COMPLETED
Built complete fund management with create, read, and delete operations
Implemented fund endpoints: POST /api/funds/create, GET /api/funds, GET /api/funds/:fundId, DELETE /api/funds/:fundId
Added comprehensive validation (min $1K, max $10M capital, unique names per user)
Integrated with authentication - all endpoints JWT-protected and user-specific
Successfully tested: Created "Tech Growth Fund" ($50K) and "Value Investment Fund" ($100K)

System Status
âœ… Authentication (JWT-based user system)
âœ… Database (PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM)
âœ… Market Data (Alpaca API integration ready)
âœ… Fund Management (Complete CRUD operations)
âœ… Foundation Ready for Phase 6 (Trading Logic & Position Management)

Technical Achievements
Resolved Docker Desktop and PostgreSQL connectivity issues
Fixed server route registration and terminal interference problems
Created robust error handling and input validation
Established proper API response formatting and JWT middleware

Next: Phase 6 - Trading Logic, Position Tracking, and Portfolio Analytics

Phase 6: Trading Logic Implementation - COMPLETED âœ…

Core Trading System
âœ… Built complete positionController.ts with buy/sell order execution
âœ… Implemented FIFO (First-In-First-Out) selling logic with position splitting
âœ… Added comprehensive P&L calculation for realized gains/losses
âœ… Created RESTful trading endpoints: POST /api/positions/buy, POST /api/positions/sell
âœ… Integrated portfolio tracking: GET /api/positions, GET /api/positions/fund/:fundId

Technical Achievements
âœ… Resolved unique constraint violations in database schema for FIFO selling
âœ… Enhanced JWT authentication integration across all trading endpoints
âœ… Implemented proper error handling with detailed debugging logs
âœ… Added fund balance validation and automatic updates with trade execution
âœ… Created comprehensive test suite demonstrating full trading functionality

Live Testing Results
ðŸ›’ Buy Order: 50 AAPL shares â†’ SUCCESS
ðŸ’° Sell Order: 25 AAPL shares @ $191.00 â†’ SUCCESS  
ðŸ’µ Realized P&L: $31.25 profit (0.66% gain)
ðŸ“ˆ Portfolio: 50 AAPL shares remaining @ $189.75
